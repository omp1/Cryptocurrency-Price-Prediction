# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction

Project for Data Science Fundamentals class

This project analyzes historical data from 50 different cryptocurrencies along with various economic indicators to explore trends and relationships in the crypto market. The focus is on building visualizations that help interpret key factors affecting cryptocurrency prices.

Using techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, the project presents multiple charts and visual summaries. A regression model is then applied — specifically targeting Bitcoin — to integrate all the available information and examine its predictive potential.

The goal of this project is to visualize, understand, and model cryptocurrency price behavior, combining statistical insight with machine learning techniques.
